    ## `$ilove@babbi ~ %`
    You run my `Hello, World`! :wink: I love you more than anyone ever, **forever**. I love and appreciate everything about you
    from your Charlie Gordon mom jokes to the cute little noises you make when we cuddle. :cat2: You're like if a cat turned into a
    sexy human with great abs and even greater hair. Thank you for taking care of me and for protecting me from all the Tolchurch 
    terrorists and the Derby hoodlums. I feel safe going to the Whitechapel KFC because of you. :heart: I love your empathy, your 
    sense of humor, and your ADHD story-telling. I find you to be endlessly fascinating and deeply caring. I hope you never change. 
    I'm grateful to have someone as emotionally intelligent as you to help me navigate social situations. :pray: In turn, I promise that I'll always 
    be here to support you and to cheer you on no matter what. I see your brilliance and your potential. That's why I've invested 100% 
    of all my fucks to give in the **:green[MEWIS]** stock. :chart_with_upwards_trend:
    
    > :rainbow[61M people died in 2023] (Ritchie & Mathieu, 2023). 

    But you didn't. That makes you a winner! :star: The 21st of May used be totally insignificant, but since the 1st of July 2023 
    – give or take a couple months :grimacing: – it has become my favorite day out of all the 365 days. I'm 
    manifesting the best day ever for you even though we have to celebrate remotely this year. :sparkles: I'm
    a little sad we can't be together since I wanted to make this day extra special for you. But don't worry, babbi, 
    I'll still make it super fun. :partying_face: All your birthdays should be as special for you as it is 
    for me. I think you should be celebrated everyday, but most especially today. You made it through another
    revolution around the sun even though life on earth really sucks sometimes. :sunny: You survived a dysfunctional 
    family, an evil dwarf, the streets (**Ilford**), Koreaboos :face_vomiting:, FTM bugs, the cost-of-living crisis...and most recently, 
    a (probably) autistic girlfriend! For that, you deserve a pat on the back, a red velvet cake, and a **:red[REDACTED]**. :tongue:
    I know you didn't celebrate much growing up but we will make the biggest deal out of all holidays and achievements
    every year from now on. :triumph: We're birthday people.

    *XOXO, BABBI* :kiss:
